Hello World Repository Testing

Hi, I am John. I am new to Git. I always use codes and apps people made on Git and I admire their works and love them. I am just starting with the tutorial and I hope I could create awesome source codes or apps for people to use them for free. "Great Journey begins with a Single Step" as the saying goes. Cheers!
